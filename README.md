# assignment-3
task1 1
The program takes a number n from the user.

It calculates the factorial of n, which is the product of all integers from 1 to n.

It prints the result 



task 2
Fist import maths than taking input from use
 Square Root Calculation
 Computes the square root of the entered number.
Uses math.sqrt() function to compute the square root.
If the number is negative, it shows an error message because the square root of a negative number is not defined in real numbers.

Natural Logarithm
Calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of the entered number.
Uses math.log() to compute the natural log.
If the number is 0 or negative, it shows an error message, since the natural logarithm is undefined for those values.


Sine Value (in Degrees) Finds the sine of the entered number, assuming the input is in degrees.
First converts degrees to radians using math.radians() because math.sin() expects radians. Then it computes the sine.
